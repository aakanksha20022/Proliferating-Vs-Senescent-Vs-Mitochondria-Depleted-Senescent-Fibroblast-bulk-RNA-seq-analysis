Proliferating-Vs-Senescent-Vs-Mitochondria-Depleted-Senescent-Fibroblast-bulk-RNA-seq-analysis
---
A bulk RNA-seq dataset comparing proliferating cells (prolif) to replicative senescent cells (senes), and replicative senescent cells which have had their mitochondria depleted (senes_MtD). 
The cells are human IMR90 fibroblasts. There are three replicates of each group, and so nine samples in total.

Input Files:
1. An Expression matrix
2. Annotation file
3. A Sample sheet
4. 3 Differential expression tables

A differential gene expression analysis was carried out comparing the three cell types using the DESeq package. The results were visualised using a combination of PCA plots, heatmaps, MA plots,
Density plots, Multi-box plots.

Pathway analysis and over-representation analysis was also performed to discover metabolic pathways associated with the most significant genes.
